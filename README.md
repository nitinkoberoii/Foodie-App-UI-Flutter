# Foodie-App-UI-Flutter

This Foodie App UI is inspired by the Food delivery app Ui kit designed on Figma by Marvis.

This project is not a full-fledged application, i.e., it does not contains any codes for backend.
Also, not all the components of this app are functional, its mostly just the UI.

This project was made as the part of practicing Flutter App Development. The additional package used was like_button v2.0.5.
pub.dev link for like_button package: https://pub.dev/packages/like_button .
